# Role & Objective
Act as a Senior UI/UX Designer and Frontend Developer. Your goal is to convert the attached reference image into a pixel-perfect Hero section using code.

# Tech Stack & Constraints

Use plain HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript (ES6+). No frameworks (React/Vue/Bootstrap).

Use Semantic HTML (e.g., <header>, <nav>, <section>, <h1>).

Use CSS Variables (:root) for all colors, font sizes, and spacing to ensure consistency.

Use CSS Flexbox and Grid for layout.

Ensure the design is fully responsive (mobile-first or desktop-down approach).

# Design & Assets Instructions

Visual Analysis: Analyze the reference image strictly for:

Color palette (extract Hex codes for background, primary, secondary, and text colors).

Typography (guess the font family or use a close Google Fonts alternative like Inter, Roboto, or Poppins).

Spacing, border-radius, and shadows.

Icons: Use Iconify Solar Linear icons for UI elements.
