DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR TILDA:

1. Open your Tilda page editor.
2. Add a new block: Select "Other" -> "T123" (HTML Code).
3. Open the file `tilda_block_1_css.html` from this folder.
4. Copy ALL the text (including <style> tags).
5. Paste it into the "Content" of the T123 block.
6. Add ANOTHER new block: "Other" -> "T123".
7. Open the file `tilda_block_2_html.html` from this folder.
8. Copy ALL the text.
9. Paste it into the "Content" of the second T123 block.
10. Click "Save and Close" and then "Publish".

Note: 
- Emojis have been converted to HTML codes (e.g. &#128247;) to prevent Tilda form breaking them.
- The background color is set to dark (#050505) in the CSS file. This will affect the block container.
