# Tone of Voice & Marketing Guidelines

This document outlines the copywriting and marketing principles for the Kover Antigravity project, based on key literature and specific user constraints.

## 📚 Foundation (Reference Books)
*   **"Pro сайты" (Evgeny Churanov):** Focus on conversion paths. Every text must lead to an action. Clear value proposition (UVP).
*   **"Predictably Irrational" (Dan Ariely):** Leverage behavioral economics. Use social proof, loss aversion ("FOMO"), and relativity (anchoring).
*   **"SPIN Selling" (Neil Rackham):** Structure content to address:
    *   **S**ituation (Context)
    *   **P**roblem (Pain points: crowds, stress, boredom)
    *   **I**mplication (Consequences of the pain)
    *   **N**eed-Payoff (Solution: our tour).
*   **"Conversion" (Services Marketing):** Sell the *transformation* and *feeling*, not just the logistics.

## 🚫 Negative Constraints (STRICTLY FORBIDDEN)
**Never use these clichés or sentence structures:**
1.  **"Те самые" / "Та самая"** (e.g., "те самые открыточные виды", "тот самый вкус").
2.  **"Это не просто..."** (e.g., "Это не просто музей, это храм...").
3.  **"Забудьте о..."** (e.g., "Забудьте о планировании", "Забудьте всё, что вы знали...").
    *   *Reason:* These are overused marketing clichés that lower trust and sound cheap.

## ✍️ Tone of Voice
*   **Confident & Direct:** Speak with authority but without arrogance.
*   **Benefit-Driven:** Don't just list features. Explain *why* it matters.
    *   *Bad:* "We have a photographer."
    *   *Good:* "You will get magazine-quality photos."
*   **Exclusive & Personal:** Make the user feel they are part of a select group ("smart travelers").
*   **Aesthetic & Sensory:** Use words that evoke images and feelings (especially for the mobile "mini-article" format).

## 🛠 Application Checklist
Before publishing any text, check:
1.  Did I use a banned phrase?
2.  Am I solving a specific problem (crowds, fatigue, organization)?
3.  Is the Call to Action clear?
